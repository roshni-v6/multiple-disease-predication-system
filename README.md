# Multiple Disease Prediction System

This is a Python-based project that uses machine learning algorithms to predict multiple diseases based on the given symptoms. This project is intended for educational and research purposes only.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Flask
- Pickle

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/multiple-disease-prediction.git`
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python app.py`

## Usage

Once you have installed the necessary packages and started the application, go to your browser and enter the URL `http://localhost:5000/` to access the application. From there, you can enter the symptoms and get the predicted diseases.

## Dataset

These are the following datasets used:
- diabetes.csv
- heart.csv
- parkinsons.csv

## Algorithm

The machine learning algorithm used for this project is the Support Vector Machine, Linear Regression. It is a powerful algorithm that is commonly used for classification and comparing tasks.
